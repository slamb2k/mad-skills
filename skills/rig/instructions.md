# Rig Instructions

Idempotently bootstrap repositories with standard development infrastructure.
Prompts and report schemas are in `references/`. Configuration procedures are
in `references/configuration-steps.md`.

**Key principle:** Prompt user before making changes. Report findings first,
get approval, then act.

---

## Pre-flight

Before starting, check all dependencies in this table:

| Dependency | Type | Check | Required | Resolution | Detail |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| git | cli | `git --version` | yes | stop | Install from https://git-scm.com |
| lefthook | npm | `npx lefthook --help` | yes | install | `npm install -g lefthook` |
| gh | cli | `gh --version` | yes | url | https://cli.github.com |

For each row, in order:
1. Run the Check command (for cli/npm) or test file existence (for agent/skill)
2. If found: continue silently
3. If missing: apply Resolution strategy
   - **stop**: notify user with Detail, halt execution
   - **url**: notify user with Detail (install link), halt execution
   - **install**: notify user, run the command in Detail, continue if successful
   - **ask**: notify user, offer to run command in Detail, continue either way (or halt if required)
   - **fallback**: notify user with Detail, continue with degraded behavior
4. After all checks: summarize what's available and what's degraded

## Phase 1: System Requirements Check

Launch **Bash subagent** (haiku — simple checks):

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "Bash",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Check system requirements",
  prompt: <read from references/phase-prompts.md#phase-1>
)
```

Parse SYSTEM_REPORT. If any requirement fails, use **AskUserQuestion**:

Options for missing git config:
- "I'll configure it manually"
- "Configure for me with: [email] / [name]"

**Stop if user chooses manual. Configure if values provided.**

---

## Phase 2: Repository Analysis

Launch **Bash subagent** (haiku):

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "Bash",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Analyze repository",
  prompt: <read from references/phase-prompts.md#phase-2>
)
```

Parse REPO_REPORT.

---

## Phase 3: Present Findings & Get Approval

Present analysis to user with **AskUserQuestion**:

```
Repository Analysis Complete

Current State:
  Git initialized: {status}
  Branch: {branch}
  Lefthook: {status}
  Commit template: {status}
  PR template: {status}
  CI workflow: {status}
  {if azdo and unregistered_pipelines:}
  Azure Pipelines: {N} YAML file(s) found, {M} not yet registered

Detected Stack:
  Type: {project_type}
  Components: {detected_components}
  Available scripts: {available_scripts}

Proposed Changes:
  {numbered list of what will be added/configured}
  {if azdo and unregistered_pipelines: "Register Azure Pipelines: {list of YAML paths}"}
```

Options:
- "Yes, configure everything"
- "Let me choose what to configure"
- "Cancel"

If "Let me choose", present individual options as multi-select.

---

## Phase 4: Execute Configuration

For each approved item, follow the procedures in
`references/configuration-steps.md`.

---

## Phase 5: Verification

Launch **Bash subagent** (haiku):

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "Bash",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Verify configuration",
  prompt: <read from references/phase-prompts.md#phase-5>
)
```

Parse VERIFY_REPORT.

---

## Phase 6: Final Report

Present summary using the template in `references/report-template.md`.

---

## Idempotency Rules

- **Skip** items already correctly configured
- **Update** items that exist but are outdated (prompt user first)
- **Add** items that are missing
- **Never delete** user's existing configuration without explicit approval
- **Merge** rather than replace when possible (e.g., add missing hooks)

---

## Error Handling

If any step fails:
1. Report the specific failure
2. Offer to skip and continue, or abort
3. Include troubleshooting suggestions

Common issues:
- No package manager -> suggest installing npm/bun
- Permission denied -> check file permissions
- Lefthook install fails -> try global install
- Git not initialized -> offer to initialize
